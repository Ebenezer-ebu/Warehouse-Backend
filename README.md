# Getting Started 
## I am a Fullstack Developer, but major in Nodejs for the backend

This is the backend part of the task.

1. What informed your choice of technologies for this task?
    I made use of React and React redux for the application development. I use react because it also allows me to create reusable UI components. It is possible to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.
    I used Node js for the backend because it is easily employed as a server-side proxy where it can handle a large amount of simultaneous connections in a non-blocking manner. 

2. What is a messaging queue?
    This is a service used in used in serverless and microservices architectures. It allow different parts of a system to communicate and process operations asynchronously.

3. What are In-memory databases, when are they required?
    In-memory databases are most commonly used in applications that demand very fast data access, storage and manipulation. databases like Redis, SQLite
